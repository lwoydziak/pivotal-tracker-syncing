This Python and Shell Script code repo has the basic structure: Build, Test and Source.

I. Build section

This section contains several utility scripts to look for source dependencies and resolve them, ensure that the acceptance and unit tests are passing, find various Python packages and lastly define the build parameters for an ANT based make system.

II. Test section

This section contains acceptance test to prove connections to Pivotal Tracker and Jira (with potential other tracker additions). Additionally, this repo contains support functionality for those tests.

III Source section

Additionally, it contains logical representations for the various supported trackers basically wrapping the APIâ€™s of each. It also contains various utility implementations for things like filtering, interfacing with configuration files, user mapping, singletons and syncing.
